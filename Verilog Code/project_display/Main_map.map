WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   VGA/NUM_ROM_INTERFACE/Madd_n0270_lut<8> is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                    1,348 out of   4,556   29%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,112
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,504 out of   3,112   80%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             231 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
