WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   M1/WORD_ROM_INTERFACE/state[2]_PWR_22_o_Select_16_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

  Number of MUXCYs used:                       272 out of   4,556    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          944

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              55 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
